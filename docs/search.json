      "contents": "\r\nOur analysis of the data shows that while many students across all regions of Tanzania study Arts subjects, there are fewer students taking science subjects. This corresponds with a lack of Science Teachers and Science textbooks.\r\nFor a developing country like Tanzania, science is crucial for technological advancement. Therefore, the education system should focus more on science subjects.\r\nTo achieve this, we suggest:\r\nAllocating more resources and funding to science education.\r\nIncreasing the number of science teachers and students.\r\nOffering higher salaries to science teachers to reduce the teaching gap.\r\nIncreasing special science-focused schools.\r\nEnsuring that fees for these special schools are similar for both government and non-government institutions.\r\nThese steps could help increase interest and participation in science subjects, which is important for Tanzania’s future development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
